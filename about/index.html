	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to my blog, <em>Fueled by Faith</em>. My name is Ryan William Moore and I grew up in small-town, Western Pennsylvania. I can't lie, I haven't been a Christian very long - you can read my <a href="/testimony">testimony</a> for more details - but I've felt lead to journaling during sermons. Sermon-journaling lead to thought journaling, which lead to prayer journaling, which now leads my here: online jounraling (blogging). I wanted to place to collect my thoughts, prayers, lessons, devotionals, and other significant <em>things</em> that I can share with others.   </p>
